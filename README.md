eneza-server
============

# What do I do?
- This server establishes a protocol that allows AJAX request to be made through text messages
- There is a current API for
    - Getting Google definitions of words
    - Getting resutls from Wolfram Alpha queries
    - Interact with the Eneza API via text message

# Test Me
- If the phone server is running
    - text "Wolfram: { YOUR QUERY HERE }" to +447568575585
    - text "Define: { YOUR WORD HERE }" to +447568575585
- Now wait for a text back and enjoy the knowledge! :D
